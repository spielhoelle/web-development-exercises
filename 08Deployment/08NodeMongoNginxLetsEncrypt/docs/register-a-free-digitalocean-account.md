__Note:__ If you want to use another provider for your server you can skip this and the next step.

## Why DigitalOcean?

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is known for fast and reliable servers at an affordable price, with lots of great features that can be added later, if they are needed.

The smallest droplet can handle multiple Node.js applications or start multiple process of the same application and costs only $5 per month (2018-02-12).

## Sign up

Go to the [Sign Up](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new) page and create a free account.

You need to wait for an activation email and click on the link inside. It can also take some additional time until all features of the account are active, as the registration could be validated by an accountant.

## Next step

In the next step we'll create your first cloud server.
