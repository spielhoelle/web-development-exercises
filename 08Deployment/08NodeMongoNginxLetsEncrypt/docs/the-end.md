You've finished the tutorial and you should be able to setup your own applications in the cloud or with any virtual / root server out there that supports an Ubuntu 16.04 image.

Always keep the most important security aspects in mind and don't create database users that have global permissions and get used in your application. Don't open ports in your firewall to the public, if this is not needed.

You found a typo or a bug in the tutorial? Shoot me a mail, please.
