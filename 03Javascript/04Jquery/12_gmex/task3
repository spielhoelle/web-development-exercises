Task 3

Extend your app to use a backend with the JQuery AJAX functionality.

1 - Hence, go into the jquery/gmprojectex folder and there install the required
    node modules using:

    $ npm install express body-parser randomstring path

2 - The files index.html, main.js and style.css are almost empty. Replace these files
    by your code or integrate your code in them. At the end, it matters that your
    frontend code works in the new environment.
3 - When the app loads, perform a GET request to /location and retrieve
    the locations as JSON.
4 - When the user creates a new location, perform a POST request to /location 
    and send a body like { lat: 12.000, lng: 13.000, title: 'Jamaica' }.
5 - When the user removes a location, perform a DELETE request to /location
    like /location/h48ca, whereas "h48ca" is the location id
