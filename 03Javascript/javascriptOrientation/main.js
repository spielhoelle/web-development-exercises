variables

1. Use the var keyword to declare a variable with variable identifier "myName" and assign a value to it.

2. Use the let keyword to declare a variable with variable identifier "_myAge" and assign a value to it.

3. Use the const keyword to declare a variable with variable identifier "$UndefinedVar" and assign an undefined value to it.

/*
data types

1. Create a variable myFirstName. 
Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the myFirstName variable and assign it to myFirstNameLength.

2. var firstName = "Charles";
   var lastName = "Adam";
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the  lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

/*
if statements
1. Create a variable a and assign 0 to it. If a is equal to false print "0 is false".

2. Create a variable b and assign 1 to it. If b is equal to true print "1 is true".

if else statements
1. 
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
If a is equal to b print "a is  equal to b". If not, print "a is not equal to b.".

2. 
var a = "string";
var b = 2;
If a is equal to b print "string is  equal to number". If not, print "string is not equal to number.".

3.
var a = 100;
var b = 50;
If a is less than or equal to b print "a is less than or equal to b". If not, print "a is not less than or equal to b.".

4.
var a = 250;
var b = 250;
If a is greater than or equal to b print "a is greater than or equal to b". If not, print "a is not greater than or equal to b.".

/*
variables and scope

1. Create a local variable in an if block. Print it.
2. Create a global variable. Differentiate it from the local variable created in question 1. 
*/

/*
arrays

1. Create an array which contains a list of all the days in a week.

2. Create an array which consists your name and your date of birth.

3. Create a nested array which contains a list of days and the dates they'll fall on starting from December 1st.

4. Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.
The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

/* 
foor loop

1. Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.

2. Create an array of all the years between 2000 and 2050 using a for loop and print them in separate lines.

3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
'#'
'##'
'###'
'####'
'#####'
'######'
'#######'

4. FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions:
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the actual number, and for numbers divisible by 5(and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
