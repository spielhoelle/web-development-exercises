# Functions, Strings & Arrays
Create a function that reverses an integer.

Be careful and think about possible solutions, before you start to
write a single line of code!

You will need to think about strings and arrays. They have some nice built-in methods, that will help you to solve the exercise.

## Expected results:
| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1234  | 4321   |
| 2048  | 8402   |
