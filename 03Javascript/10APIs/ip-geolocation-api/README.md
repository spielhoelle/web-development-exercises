# IP Location + Google Maps API

## Exercise

You will create a full-width Google Map that zooms into the closest position that we can retrieve by checking the [IP Geolocation API](https://ipinfo.io/products#core-api).

__You have to create:__

- A class that loads the GeoData from the API
- A class that:
    - loads the default map
    - handles the geolocation data
    - adds an infoWindow with details
    - sets a default map marker (red)
    - centers the map to the IP location
    - zooms into the center of the map

 __Important:__

 You need to get your own Google Maps API key, from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
