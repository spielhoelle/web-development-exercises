# Functions & Arrays

Create a function that capitalizes every first letter of string of words.

Be careful and think about possible solutions, before you start to
write a single line of code!

You will need to think about strings and arrays, as strings and also
arrays have some nice built-in methods, that will help you to solve
the exercise.

The string:<br>
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sheep.`

Should become:<br>
`The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Sheep.`
