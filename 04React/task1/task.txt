1. Create an empty new React App.
2. Create two new components: UserInput and UserOutput
3. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input change event.
8. Ensure, that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput.
9. Add databinding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
